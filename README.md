## 🚀 Overview

FCAT is a desktop assistant for EVE Online fleet commanders.  
- **Live Fleet Hierarchy** — mirrors in‑game Wings/Squads/FC  
- **Role & Ship Breakdowns** — DPS, Logistics, Boosters, etc.  
- **Boost Script Tracking** — reads your local boost‑chat logs  
- **Automated Alerts** — missing logi, DPS % below threshold  
- **First‑Run Wizard** — helps you configure boost channels  
- **Crash Reporter** — copies error details to clipboard for easy sharing

## 🎉 First Run

On first launch, FCAT will guide you through a quick wizard to set your “Booster Channels” (chat channels where your boosters post scripts). You can always edit these later via **Settings → Booster Channels…**.
